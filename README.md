[*SparkFun OpenLog Artemis (SPX-16832)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/16832)

The OpenLog Artemis is an open source datalogger that comes preprogrammed to automatically log IMU, GPS, serial data, and various pressure, humidity, and distance sensors. All without writing a single line of code! OLA automatically detects, configures, and logs Qwiic sensors. OLA is designed for users who just need to capture a bunch of data to SD and get back to their larger project.

The firmware in this repo is dedicated to logging high rate serial data. [You can find the main OpenLog Artemis repo here](https://github.com/sparkfun/OpenLog_Artemis).

OpenLog Artemis is highly configurable over an easy to use serial interface. Simply plug in a USB C cable and open a terminal at 115200kbps. The logging output is automatically streamed to both the terminal and the microSD. Pressing any key will open the configuration menu.

New features are constantly being added so weâ€™ve released an easy to use firmware upgrade tool. No need to install Arduino or a bunch of libraries, simply open the [Artemis Firmware Upload GUI](https://github.com/sparkfun/Artemis-Firmware-Upload-GUI), load the latest OLA firmware, and add features to OpenLog Artemis as they come out! Full instructions are available in [UPGRADE.md](./UPGRADE.md).

Limitations
-------------------

This firmware works well with baud rates up to 230400. Near-continuous (80% duty, ~20KB/s) logging of NMEA data at 230400 produces clean log files.
The wheels come off at 460800 baud, for reasons we don't yet understand.
